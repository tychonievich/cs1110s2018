# Pairing

Have them pair up however they wish.  If there is an odd number, make one group of 3.

Overview pair programming.

-   **2 minds, 1 focus**
-   **Driver and Navigator**
-   **Equality and Communication**
-   **Switch Roles**

You should enforce only one computer open between the pair and announce times to switch roles.

# Grid of Doors

Explain this is a pseudo-code and problem solving exercise.
Also that reading instructions is important; they should first read the assignment in full together with their partner, ask any clarifying questions, then return to the top and work through it in order.

Announce that we grade labs primarily on participation;
it is more important that they have a good solution to the first step than that the solve all four steps.
