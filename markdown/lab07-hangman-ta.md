title: "Lab 7: Hangman"
...


# Purpose of this lab

This lab has three goals

1.	Help them see the relationship between `if` and `while`.
2.	Help them develop a full program with limited scaffolding.
3.	Reinforce the idea of string methods and if statements.

If they finish, their `hangman_if.py` code will be quite long (hundreds of lines) and very repetitive.  This is correct.
This `hangman_while.py` code will be much shorter.

# Overview

Remind the students that

1.	They write two files; the first should *not* use loops
2.	The directions give hints
3.	PyCharm has a find-replace tool (demonstrate it for them) they are likely to find useful

# Spot Check

Because of the exam and reading days, there were no assignments due since last lab, so no spot-check this week.  It will resume next week.


# Example solution

I don't usually do this, but this code is so strange-looking I suspect many TAs will think the correct code looks wrong:
