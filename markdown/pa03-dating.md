# Task

There is a folk rule that says you can date people as young as half your
age plus seven years old. This suggests they can date you if they are as
old as twice your age minus thirteen.
See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) for more.

Write a program called `dating.py`.
When run, it should 

1. ask the user for their age.
2. print the range of ages of people they can date.

Please match our prompts, etc, exactly.
Your program should work for any integer age â‰¥ 14 that we provide.
It should always answer with integer ages.
