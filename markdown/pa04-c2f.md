Please match our prompts, etc, exactly.
Your program should work for any numeric temperature that we provide.

You are welcome to look up the Celcius to Fahrenheit formula, but if you do remember to cite your source!

# Thought Question

Looking for more practice?  Feel free to try (but not submit) the following:

-   Write a program that goes Fahrenheit to Celsius
-   Write a program that goes from Celsius to both Fahrenheit *and* Kelvin (and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_of_temperature#Conversion_table_between_different_temperature_scales) if you want)
-   Write a program that does some other unit conversion, such as miles per gallon to inverse square meters
-   Write a program that does a multi-input conversation, such as
    
    ````
    What is the R-value of your insulation? 30
    How large is your wall, in square feet? 2400
    What is the outside temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit? 48
    Your wall loses heat at about 563 watts
