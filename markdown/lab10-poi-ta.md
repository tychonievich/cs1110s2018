# Exam Reminder

Remind them that we have an exam next week, with [study topics and last semester's exam](review.html) linked from the schedule for the review day.

# Running the Lab

The task we ask is not large, but it involves several new ideas.
Help them remember

-   the open-read-decode sequence (or open-for-decode)
-   to split on commas
-   use the provided distance code (it can be used as-is; not work to do on it)

# On your feet

As a mid-semester reminder, recall the following from the Lab 3 writeup:

> Students that need help are much more likely to ask for it if you are up and about, near them, waiting for them to ask.
> They are also much more likely to pair correctly if you observe them and correct poor pairing practices.
> 
> > I have reports from previous students that "most TAs just sit in the front of the room and ignore us." I really, *really* hope these are exaggerations of frustrated students or people noticing the spot-checks we tried last semester (and are not repeating this semester, as they basically didn't work).
