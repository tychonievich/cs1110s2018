Per <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/exams.html#1182">the registrar</a>, all sections of 1110 and 1111 will have their final exam at **7--10 pm on Thursday, 3 May 2018**. These will be in:

Section     Exam location       Notes
----------- ------------------- --------------
1110-001    Wilson 402          
1110-002    Olson 120           
1110-003    Wilson 301          Wilson 301 is too small, but Wilson 402 next door is larger than needed. We'll move some students from 301 to 402.
1111-001    Thorton E303        

7pm exams in large rooms tend to have **heating** problems, fluctuating between too cold and too warm over the course of the exam. Dress in layers.

Some of you will have conflicts with that exam time. Per university policy,

> Faculty members are not authorized to change th\[e final exam\] schedule. Exceptions may be authorized only by the faculty member's dean's office.

Our approved makeup time is 7--10pm on Wednesday 2 May 2018. To report a conflict and request accomodation at that time, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM5gG6E1xK1SXkYaaYeUChVqebdeMVfrY1yKXtvX5Ju-oFEw/viewform?usp=sf_link) -- note, you'll need to log in with your @virginia.edu google account.

<!--
The deadline for reporting conflicts with the final has passed. If you have not been informed of an alternative arrangement, it is probably too late to get one now as the makeup exam room we were given is not large enough to add more people.

A **TA-led review session** will be held in Chem 402 on Wednesday, 6 December at 2pm.
