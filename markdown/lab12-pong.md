# Mechanics

There will be 

1.  Pairing up for the coming game project (and for this lab)
1.  Initial partner planning for game project
1.  Working on filling in missing code of a Pong game.

# Pairing

It is time to get ready for your [game project](project.html).
Things to note.

-   This is a paired assignment.  Pick someone you can work with and who has a schedule similar to yours.  The TAs may help match you up.
-   TAs have final say-so on partners. They have been instructed to match within lab sections.
-   Your partner, once entered by a TA, will show up near the bottom of the submission site under "Project".
-   You'll have to decide on your own game.  It will be a 2D game using gamebox, as we have a few other requirements in the project description, but you can make many different games within these rules.
-   You will be submitting weekly checkpoints.  We won't tell you exactly what you need in each, but we do expect to see steady progress.
-   There will still be other individual assignments during the project time.  Plan your time accordingly!

# Pong

Today we are doing an example game in gamebox; specifically the classic game *Pong*.
If you are unfamiliar with Pong, head over to [http://www.ponggame.org/](http://www.ponggame.org/) to see what it's all about.

We'll play by a basic version of the rules:

-   There is a ball that bounces back and forth.
-   Move your paddle on your side of the screen to prevent it from getting past you.
-   If it gets past you, your opponent earns a point.
-   First player to 10 points wins.

After you've figured out how the game plays, copy the following files and code into a new Python file in the same directory as your `gamebox.py` file:

-   [gamebox.py](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/files/gamebox.py)
-   [pong.py](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/files/pong.py)

## Finish `pong.py`

If you run the game as is, you should see what the game will look like, but nothing actually works.
We have left comments in the `pong.py` file that describes the code you need to add to make the game work.
Add some code, try it out, and keep going until you have a working Pong game!


## Submission

**At least one partner** should submit one .py file named `pong.py` to Archimedes (the submission system):
[https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/](https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/).
Please put **all partners' ids** in comments at the top of the file.
