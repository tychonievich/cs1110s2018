Per <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/exams.html#1182">the registrar</a>, all sections of 1110 and 1111 will have their final exam at **7--10 pm on Thursday, 3 May 2018**. These will be in:

Section     Instructor          Exam location             
----------- -----------------   --------------------------
1110-001    Tychonievich        Wilson 301 or Wilson 402\*
1110-002    Dill                Olson 120           
1110-003    Tychonievich        Wilson 301 or Wilson 402\*
1111-001    Praphamontripong    Thorton E303

\* Sections 001 and 003: go to Wilson 301 if the digit in your computing ID is a 3, 6, or 8; go to Wilson 402 if it is 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9. Sorry about this; they didn't give us the right sized rooms...

7pm exams in large rooms tend to have **heating** problems, fluctuating between too cold and too warm over the course of the exam. Dress in layers.

Some of you will have conflicts with that exam time. Per university policy,

> Faculty members are not authorized to change th\[e final exam\] schedule. Exceptions may be authorized only by the faculty member's dean's office.

Our approved makeup time is 7--10 pm on Wednesday 2 May 2018.

<!--
 To report a conflict and request accomodation at that time, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM5gG6E1xK1SXkYaaYeUChVqebdeMVfrY1yKXtvX5Ju-oFEw/viewform?usp=sf_link) -- note, you'll need to log in with your @virginia.edu google account.

The deadline for reporting conflicts with the final has passed. If you have not been informed of an alternative arrangement, it is probably too late to get one now. Prof Tychonievich might still be able to fit you in if you have a two-exams-at-the-same-time conflict (email him in this case), but no guarantees.

A **TA-led review session** will be held in Chem 402 on Wednesday, 2 December at 2pm.
