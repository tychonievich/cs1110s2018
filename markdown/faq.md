# I need into the course or to switch section

We have completed all of the section changes and enrollment permissions we were able to accommodate; at this point all seats are controlled by SIS.

<!--
Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdKT7TBKz9vg_2IfYAuPM7ErZ7Oy05EQAxVT7-Ooj_l_maRA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Note that we are somewhat constrained by fire code limits on room capacity, so no guarantees, but we'll try to accommodate everyone we can.
We will contact you if we are able to accommodate your request.

# Which CS 111x should I take?

All of the CS 111x courses provide a full introduction to programming sufficient to take additional CS courses.
Students who took all versions perform comparably in CS 2110.

CS 1110
:   A general section, designed to teach as many students as possible.
    Most (but not all) who take this course have no prior programming experience.

CS 1111
:   A general section, tailored for those with some experience but not enough to test out of the course.
    Has exactly the same assignments, grading, etc, as CS 1110 but meets less often and does not have labs.

CS 1112
:   Covers the same material as CS 1110/1111, but is organized based on the assumption that *none* of the students have any prior programming experience.
    It makes use of several techniques that have been found to be particularly effective for such students, such as an integrated lecture and lab, a different assignment set, required attendance and participation, etc.
    This comes at the cost of being unable to seat everyone who wants in and being less suited for those with some prior experience.

Placement Test
:   If you have programmed before, you can likely place out of *Introduction to Programming* entirely.
    Placement tests are offered in the CS department offices (Rice 527); no appointment is necessary.
    If you pass the placement test, we advise taking CS 2110 to expand your programming ability further.

<!--

CS 1113
:   A generic number for more audience-specific introductions to programming,
    generally by emphasizing the topics that specific disciplines find useful.
    Fall 2017 section 1113-001 and Spring 2018 1113-002 is designed for engineers, pulling examples and assignments from common engineering domains
    and teaching some tools and techniques engineers are likely to find useful.
    Spring 2018 section 1113-001 is designed for arts and science majors, presenting a less engineery approach to the topic.

-->

You might also consider taking CS 1511.
CS 1511 is based off the successful CS Principles project and presents broader overview of CS topics.
CS 111*x* will teach you programming skills and related topics;
CS 1511 will teach you computational thinking and digital citizenship.

<!--
# The course is listed as restricted

CS courses are open to students in all majors, but for the initial periods of registration many are restricted to students in majors that require the course.

See <http://tinyurl.com/spring-2018-cs-scheduling> for when enrollment limitations will change.
The CS Department has no control over the exact time of day that the restriction changes.

If you are not eligible to sign up for a full course, you cannot get on the waiting list. But, put yourself on the waiting list as soon as you can, because at the start of the term, waiting lists often shrink and many students do eventually get in.


# I plan to declare a major that gets early enrollment

Until your major is coded in SIS by the registrar, limitations on enrollment will hold as listed.
We will not make any exceptions based on intended major declarations.
-->
<!-- 

# Will the course fill up before I have a chance to enroll?

We hope not.
We have added capacity at a dramatically increased pace in recent semesters; 
there are 914 seats across 111x offerings in Spring 2018, compared to 806 in Spring 2017.
Peak waiting list capacity in Spring 2017 was about 140 students and final enrollment was 753,
so we will probably still have a few people waitlisted this year,
but hopefully all will get seats as students change courses before the Add Deadline.

Demands is also increasing, though, so no guarantees.
Only about half of the students at UVA take CS 111x right now,
so demand may yet double, though it is unlikely to do so in a single year.

-->

# How do I get off the waitlist?

In order to come off the wait list, there has to be an open seat in **both** the lecture and lab you are signed up for. If one or the other is not true, then SIS moves on to the next student who has the right combination.  Basically, this means switching to a section (or pair of sections) offered at a less-popular time.

See also [I need into the course or to switch section] above.

<!--

Our main cap is lab capacity.
Each room has a fire-code-enforced upper limit on enrollment.
The vast majority of our lab sections are listed at that upper limit in SIS, giving us no ability to seat special cases.
In general,

Some examples of special cases include:

-   Current SEAS 2nd year or higher that has not taken a CS 1 class yet
-   Incoming SEAS transfer 2nd year or higher
-   Early graduation

If you feel you warrant special consideration and are currently on the waitlist, please fill out the form here: [https://goo.gl/forms/rL5Mx4c6cjYVP1t53](https://goo.gl/forms/rL5Mx4c6cjYVP1t53)

All SEAS Students will be given a seat, once each, provided they fill out the above form.  If you lose it by dropping and re-adding the course, we cannot re-accommodate you.

Earlier there was a link here to a form to submit a waiting list appeal. We have already handled all those appeals and have relinquished control over our extra seats. We no longer have resources to honor additional appeals.

*CLAS (and other schools) Students:*

- If you are a first year, we're sorry, but you probably won't get the course this semester. You are welcome to stay on the wait list to see what happens.
- If you are thinking about the BA major in CS, you need to take 1110 by your third semester. You still have plenty of time. If this is your third semester or later, fill out the form above.
- If you are in a major that requires CS 1110 (Math, Cog Sci -- note *NOT* Commerce!) and are either a third or fourth year, use the form above.


*Consider the other CS1 courses:*

We are offering three other CS1 courses this semester: CS 1112 with Jim Cohoon (for students with no programming experience) and CS 1113 with Kevin Sullivan (for non-engineers). These are both good options to consider and all count the same for prerequisites and major requirements!  CS 1511 this semester is also an introduction to computer science, though with a broader scope (and thus less programming depth) than our other CS1 offerings.

We wish we could take everyone that wanted CS 1110 or CS 1111, but it’s simply not feasible with the room sizes and resources we have. Please do try again next semester if you can’t get in this time.

Let us know if you have any questions.

-->

# If I'm at waiting list position *n*, how likely am I to get a seat?

First, we have no control over this at all.  It depends entirely on other students dropping the course.

Second, SIS will only tell you your *lecture* position, but your *lab* position is typically what matters to getting a seat.  Meaning that the waiting list position number stated by SIS is close to meaningless.

In the past, we have had fairly steady drops from the first day of class up to the add deadline, generally with between 5 and 15% turnover.
But the variance is high and we cannot predict which labs people will drop out of.

See also [I need into the course or to switch section] above.

# Will you sign a course action form?

Only for course overload, and only if there are open seats in both the lecture and lab section in question.  All other course action form varieties violate room capacity and fire-code limits and will not be approved.

# Can I switch which lab I'm waiting for?

Yes, by dropping the class and re-adding the appropriate waiting list.
Note that this will put you on the *back* of the waiting list.
There is no way to change which lab you are waiting for without moving to the back of that lab's list.

If the new lab (and lecture) have not waiting list, this will cause you to end up enrolled, not wait-listed.

# What can I do while on the waiting list?

You are welcome to come to 1110 lectures in Wilson hall (the 10am and 2pm sections), but not to physically come to labs (the first week's lab being an exception: you may come to that), though attempting the lab activities on your own is encouraged.
1111 lectures and the 1110 lecture in Rice hall typically fill the room, so you might be asked to leave the room to make space for those enrolled if you attend those lectures while on a waiting list.

We hope to also give you the ability to submit assignments while on the waiting list so that when/if you get off you are in no way behind on your work.
No promises, though.


# My computer died. What do I do?

As this is a programming class, we do expect you to have access to a computer for the duration of the semester.
If you are temporarily without a working machine, Python and PyCharm should be installed on publicly available machines in Alderman Library and other locations.

We expect you to make regular backups of your code so in the event of a failure you still have access to your assignments.
We will not accept a computer failure as a reason to waive a late penalty for an assignment.

We highly suggest you look into using a cloud-based solution to make constant backups of particular directories on your computer, such as UVaBox found at [http://its.virginia.edu/box/](http://its.virginia.edu/box/) or Dropbox found at [http://dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com).
You can also do some basic assignments in an in-browser Python environment such as 
[https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/), [http://c9.io](http://c9.io), [http://pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com), etc.

If none of the above options work for you, the department has a small number of laptops it can loan out to students enrolled in CS classes.  To gain access to one, talk to your professor (who has to make the request on your behalf).

# Can I permanently swap sections?

Not easily… 

If all of the following are true:

-   You are swapping into a lecture and lab that both have open seats
-   You have no time conflicts with the new times on your schedule
-   You do not have a financial or other hold

... then you can swap via SIS.
In any other case, we'll need to contact a registrar to make that happen, and it will depend on room availability.
See [I need into the course or to switch section] above for how to get us the information needed to put you on our list of people to try to get swapped.

## If you are currently on a waiting list
See [Can I switch which lab I'm waiting for](#can-i-switch-which-lab-im-waiting-for) above.
The same logic applies to lectures.

<!--
## I'm currently enrolled, but there are enrollment restrictions now
You'll have to wait for the restrictions to lift so that you could enroll before you can change section.
See [The course is listed as restricted](#the-course-is-listed-as-restricted) above.
-->

# Can I go to different lab section this week?

Due to fire code limits, you cannot attend another lab session, even for just one week.
We're also doing group work, so you need to be there for your team.

If you need to do this because of conflict with another class or test, your other professor should provide you with an alternate time since you have a scheduled university class (this lab) at this time.

Missing one week in general will not affect your grade. Every student can miss one lab with no penalty (and you do not need to make up the work).


# I'm in the *X* lecture, can I go to the *Y* lecture instead?

1111 students can attend an 1110 section on occasion if they like, though doing so will not excuse any missed attendance or participation activities.
1110 students should not attend 1111 lectures due to the size of the classroom.
1110 students can attend a different 1110 section on occasion as well, though if your instructor tracks attendance or participation those need to be done in your lecture, and if the Rice hall lecture fills up we'll ask those not enrolled in that section to leave.


# Can I take my test in a different lecture section?

Absolutely not.

# I have another final exam at the same time as our final exam. What do I do?

When we get closer to the end of the semester, we'll have a form you'll fill out to get a separate time. We will accommodate most all cases here with no issue. Please do not email us about this before the end of the semester as we will have no other information to tell you.


# I have travel and will miss the final exam. What do I do?

University policy does not provide any accommodations for travel.
If you believe you are an exception, contact your dean; only deans may approve final exam rescheduling.

Know in advance that "I already paid for airline tickets" is *not* a special case.


# My program handled all the example inputs correctly but still got a 0.  Why?

This could be a grading error, but could also be because you hard-coded those specific cases instead of solving the general problem (see [the syllabus](syllabus.html#generality-of-solutions)).

# What is "hard-coding"?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding) defines it as "embedding [...] an input or configuration data directly into the source code of a program."
In this course, it most commonly appears when students solve the examples but not the general problem.

For example, suppose we ask for "a function called `sum` that computes the sum of two numbers.  For example, `sum(2, 3)`{.python} should give `5` and `sum(-1.1, 1.0)`{.python} should give `-0.1`."
A correct solution would solve the general problem, like this:

````python
def sum(x, y):
    '''returns the mathematical sum of its arguments'''
    return x + y
````

Conversely, a solution with the example inputs hard-coded might look like this:

````python
def sum(x, y):
    '''a hard-coded solution that returns the mathematical sum 
        of (2, 3) and (-1.1, 1.0), but not most other values'''
    if x < 0: 
        return -0.1
    else:
        return 5
````


# My WiFi isn't working…

UVA makes three different wireless networks available to students.  If one is down, try a different one

1. Cavalier -- this network is encrypted (meaning it's more secure) and tends to be best supported.  It should be your default.  See [ITS's guide](http://its.virginia.edu/wireless/encrypted.html) for getting it set up.

2. Wahoo -- this network is unencrypted and also usually unlisted.  It also requires you register your device:

    1.  See [ITS's page](http://its.virginia.edu/mobile/other-mobile.html) on this network, but especially the [device registration](https://netreg.itc.virginia.edu/cgi-bin/mac_registration.cgi) page.
    
    2. You may have to manually enter the name `wahoo` in your network manager for your computer to find this network.

3. Welcome -- this network is unencrypted and intended for guest use, but you can register as your own guest:
    
    1.  Select the `Welcome_to_UVa_Wireless` network
    2.  Open a browser -- you'll be redirected to [this site](https://network-setup.itc.virginia.edu/welcome/welcome.cgi)
    3.  Click the button under the "guest" option -- you're registering as your own guest.
    4.  Click the small underlined link "Guest Wireless Passcode site."
    5.  Submit (you don't need to fill out the form unless you want to)
    6.  **write down** the passcode; you'll have to enter it manually repeatedly.
    7.  Back in the page you were looking at during step 4, enter the passcode in the field labeled "Passcode:" and click "Log In"

It is uncommon for all three wireless networks to be down at the same time.  In my experience, `Welcome_to_UVa_Wireless` in particular is almost always up, in part because it is annoying to have to keep entering passcodes so few people use it.

# Can I make an announcement in CS 1110 or CS 1111?

We get so many of these requests that we cannot grant them all, and to avoid being unfair we generally do not grant any of them.
If the announcement is purely academic in nature and there is a compelling reason why Introduction to Programming lecture is the right place to make it, email the professors; but we still make no guarantee we'll accommodate you.

Raising your hand in class to make an announcement (rather than to ask or answer a question) is [unprofessional behavior](syllabus.html#professionalism) and will be treated as such.


# I need more help...

Have you tried office hours? We have a lot of students, but we also have a lot of TAs (and several faculty members) and they are generally the best-qualified and best-prepared help you will find. If you find otherwise, please let your instructor (or Prof Tychonievich as the lead instructor) know and we'll try to improve things.

If that is not working for you, SEAS also offers free tutoring for all of its classes to all students (in SEAS or not); see <https://engineering.virginia.edu/current-students/current-undergraduate-students/current-undergrads-tutoring> for more.

# Can I make up a missed lecture or lab?

All lecture and lab activities that are graded are graded on participation and involvement in a group setting, not on final product.
As such, if you were not there you missed out on that experience and no make-up is possible.

However, we assume every student will have one week where they cannot participate, and excuse one missed session automatically.

## But I have an exam in another class that conflicts with my lab time

University policy requires courses having evening exams for day-time classes to provide alternative accommodations for SIS-scheduled conflicts, including CS 1110 labs. We will not excuse these absences; please contact your other course's instructor for an alternative exam time instead.

## But I have a valid excuse

That is the exact kind of thing the one free missed session is intended to cover. No need to tell us about it; the system will excuse it automatically.

## But I already used my automatic excused absence

If you have valid excuses for *more than one* missed sessions, let us know (typically by telling your TA in the next such session) and we can enter an extra excused absence for you.
Note that to get extra excused absences, you need to demonstrate that all of them were beyond your control, even the previously-automatic one.
