# Logic Puzzle

The every-class logic puzzles last semester didn't work very well; we'll try just a couple this semester.

1.  Announce "Get in groups of 3 (2 or 4 are fine)"
1.  Bring up on the screen this: [Flashlight bridge](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cu_mF6NXrFIxl4fUOmNuRax_z0EYZj-j587tUmayjNA/edit?usp=sharing)
1.  Announce "Work with your group to solve this problem"
1.  Wander the room, but respond to all questions with "I'm not a part of your group. What does your group think?" No matter what they say, nod and move on.
1.  After 5--10 minutes, 
    -   ask "how many of you got 19 seconds?" (wait for hands) "Congratulations! You think like most rational people."
        -   You may ask one to review how it works, or skip if all got it.
        -   I suggest illustrating their narrative
            
            side 1  side 2  time
            ------- ------- ---------
            ABCD f          0
            CD      AB  f   +2 = 2
            ACD f   B       +1 = 3
            D       ABC f   +5 = 8
            AD f    BC      +1 = 9
                    ABCD f  +10 = 19

    -   ask "did anyone have an answer smaller than 19 seconds?" and have them share
        -   If they have the fastest person carry the other people, ask "How fast do you think I can run a mile?" "How fast do you think I can run a mile with you on my back?"
        -   If they have the flashlight thrown, ask "how long is the bridge? Do we know they can throw that far?"
        -   If they have one person stand in the middle and everyone else run past, ask "how long is the bridge? How far does the light shine?"
        -   If they have a 17-minute solution, have them explain it to the class
            -   "What do we think if this solution?"
            -   "Based on the thunderous applause" (wait for applause if needed) "we like this solution!"
1.  Announce "We'll do another one or two of these in coming labs; for now, let's begin the main lab activity."

> Do not offer hints, solutions, or clarifying explanations.
> During sharing, don't say "that's a bad solution"---instead ask a question that helps them see it is bad, like those listed above

# Overview

Giving a brief overview of the lab would be wise:

1.	You'll write one file with 9 functions in it
	-	It may also contain testing code, or you may put the tests elsewhere
	-	You might not get to all functions; that's OK
	-	You'll submit your file (and maybe a second file if you get to task 10)
1.	We haven't taught you everything you need
	-	But there is a "Tools to Use" section that does
	-	We want you to practice reading and applying on your own
	-	We will help, but we'll ask what you've already tried first...
1.	Read the writeup, then do the tasks
	-   (Suggestion: start them down the path for the first problem: bring it up, talk about it, scroll down to where the operators are described, let them loose)
	

# Helping

One goal is that the students learn some on their own.
Most questions should be answered with questions:

-	What have you already tried?
	-	Did that work?
	-	How do you know it (did/didn't) work?
-	Which tools do you think would work for this?
	-	How could you find out?
	-	Which ones have you tried already?
		-	I'd suggest trying a few...
-	Have you tried working out what it would do yourself using a pencil and paper?
-	Have you tried running it in <http://pythontutor.com>?

Followed by

-	Give that a go and see what happens.

Avoid the temptation to say "yes" or "no" when they ask if something will work.  Instead, "Try it and see."
