# Grading Groups

1. Announce the students should sit near others they might want to partner with this semester, including for the final project.

2. When someone says "but my friend is in a different lab" say "the instructors are aware this happens and will address it more closer to the project date. For now, just sit with those you want to work with in lab."

3. Each TA should take a different part of the room and construct a grading group (of about 12 students).

    Go to <https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/gradegroup.php> and 
    
    1.  Select your lab section.
    1.  Add a grading group for yourself from the drop-down.
    1.  Drag students to your grading group.
    
    This will also count as attendance/participation grade for this lab, so don't assign people who are not present.
    
    If you are in a lab with one too few TAs, go ahead and make the final target number of grading groups, using faculty (lat7h, up3f, cd9au) as place-holders for TAs not yet assigned.

# Pairing

Have them pair up however they wish.  If there is an odd number, make one group of 3.

Remind them about pair programming.

-   **2 minds, 1 focus**
-   **Driver and Navigator**
-   **Equality and Communication**
-   **Switch Roles**

You should **enforce** only one computer open between the pair and announce times to switch roles.

An example of how to enforce 1-computer:

TA
:   *(places a hand on each laptop screen)* Pair programming works best if you both focus on the same thing. Which computer should I close?

Student
:   We're using this one for the lab writeup and that one for code.

TA
:   That's still two things to focus on. Which one should I close?

Student
:   But we're just using both screens together.

TA
:   I believe you. For now. Which one should I close^[Noticing a pattern? There is power in stubborn repetition of the same phrase over and over. This is not a negotiation: they are going to use one screen, not two, and saying it the same way every time helps subconsciously reinforce that message.] to keep that shared focus going?

In my experience, eventually this will result in one or the other closing a screen; I've not needed to actually do the closing. In very rare cases I've had to call over another TA and say in their hearing^[But that's so mean!] ^[Yes, but the sooner they understand that you are in charge of lab, the sooner you can move from enforcer to friend.] ^[But I'm *already* their friend.] ^[As a student, I'm sure you are. I'm talking about as a TA. It's different. You'll see (if you trust me on this and start out mean; you probably won't see if you don't).] "hey, this pair is violating the rules of pair programming on day one; what should I do about it?"

# On your feet

Students that need help are much more likely to ask for it if you are up and about, near them, waiting for them to ask.
They are also much more likely to pair correctly if you observe them and correct poor pairing practices.

> I have reports from previous students that "most TAs just sit in the front of the room and ignore us." I really, *really* hope these are exaggerations of frustrated students or people noticing the spot-checks we tried last semester (and are not repeating this semester, as they basically didn't work).

# Normalize struggle

Not all lectures saw the same set of turtle operations.
Some students also played with it more than others.
That's OK.
This is a learn-by-trying exercise, so try and see what you learn.

# Each student should submit

For most labs one submission per partnership is fine; but for this one we are hoping to debug their ability to submit, so

-  **Both** should submit a `.py` file
-  at most **One** should submit an image for the contest
